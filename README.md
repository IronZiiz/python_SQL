# SQLAlchemy for Data Science and Data Analysis

This repository documents practical implementations and examples using **Python** and **SQL** through the **SQLAlchemy** library. It is designed to serve as a learning and reference resource for **Data Science** and **Data Analysis** workflows that involve relational databases.

## üìå Objectives

- Demonstrate how to connect and interact with databases using SQLAlchemy.
- Show how SQL and Python can be combined effectively for data-driven projects.
- Explore real-world use cases with both **SQLite** and **PostgreSQL**.
- Provide clean, readable, and reusable code for querying, filtering, and analyzing data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.**  
- **SQLAlchemy** (ORM and Core mode)  
- **SQLite** (Local database for fast prototyping)  
- **PostgreSQL** (Cloud-ready production database)  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (for interactive exploration)

- ## üìä Focus Areas

- Creating and managing database tables using SQLAlchemy  
- Performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Executing raw SQL queries and integrating them with Pandas  
- Filtering and grouping data for analysis  
- Managing relationships between tables  
- Connecting to PostgreSQL databases remotely
